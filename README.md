# RapidBlock
A tool for syndicating domain blocks across the Fediverse.

RapidBlock is still under heavy development.  However, Debian and Ubuntu users
will be delighted to know that there is now an APT repository for RapidBlock:

* [apt.rapidblock.org](https://apt.rapidblock.org/)

You can set up this repository and automatically install RapidBlock for the
first time by running:

```sh
curl -s https://apt.rapidblock.org/install.sh | sudo bash
```
